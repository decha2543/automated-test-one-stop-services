# Automated Test One-Stop Service

A cross-platform, one-stop workspace for test automation — Playwright (web/API),
Robot Framework, and k6 (performance) — driven by a single `task` CLI and an
optional local web **Hub**. Projects are manifest-driven and portable; the Hub
wraps the same CLI recipes behind a browser UI (run tests, view reports, manage
environments) with no deploy required.

## Quick start (1-click)

Download the installer for your OS from the
[latest release](https://github.com/decha2543/automated-test-one-stop-services/releases/latest)
and run it — it bootstraps git, clones the workspace, installs the toolchain +
dependencies, and starts the Hub:

- **Windows**: `automated-test-one-stop-service_installer_windows.bat`
- **macOS / Linux**: `automated-test-one-stop-service_installer_mac-and-linux.sh`

Already have a clone? The same two files live under
[`scripts/setup/`](scripts/setup/). Then open the Hub at <http://localhost:5174>.

Nothing has to be set up or configured first, and no administrator rights are
needed — every tool is installed for your user only (macOS does not need
Homebrew). Each run writes an `install-log-<timestamp>.txt` — on Windows in the
folder you picked, on macOS/Linux in the folder you ran the installer from. That
is the file to read, or to send on, if anything fails.

### "Is this safe?" — the security warning

The installer is **not code-signed yet**, so on a fresh machine your operating
system may warn that it doesn't recognize it. This is expected for a new tool —
it's a reputation check, not a virus report. Download it **only** from the
official repository, then allow it to run. The steps are the same shape on every
OS:

1. **Windows** — double-click the `.bat`. If you see **"Windows protected your
   PC"**, click **More info**, then **Run anyway**.
2. **macOS** — if double-clicking is blocked, **Control-click (right-click) →
   Open → Open**, or run `bash <installer>.sh` in Terminal.
3. **Linux** — make it executable, then run it:
   `chmod +x <installer>.sh && ./<installer>.sh` (or just `bash <installer>.sh`).

> The real warning is always a **system dialog**, never a web page. Ignore any
> browser pop-up that imitates it, and only run the file you downloaded from the
> official link.

Want to be sure the file is the published one? Each release also ships
`SHA256SUMS.txt`. Download it next to the installer, then:

```bash
# Windows (PowerShell or cmd) — compare the printed hash with SHA256SUMS.txt
certutil -hashfile automated-test-one-stop-service_installer_windows.bat SHA256

# macOS / Linux
shasum -a 256 -c SHA256SUMS.txt
```

### What happens next (so nothing looks "stuck")

A console window opens and shows progress — **keep it open**. The first run
installs tools and can take several minutes (it's working, not frozen). When it
finishes it **opens the Hub in your browser automatically** and adds a **"Test
Hub"** shortcut to your desktop so you can reopen it anytime.

One click is left before the first web test: browsers are downloaded per tool,
not by the installer. In the Hub, open the **Environment Status** panel and press
**Set up** on the tool you want (the CLI equivalent is `task setup`). If setup
had to skip Python (locked-down network), the same panel has **Install Python**.

The Hub UI speaks **Thai and English** — it follows your browser language on the
first visit, and you can switch it any time from the header toggle or
**Settings → Language**. The installer console stays English on purpose: Windows
console fonts don't carry Thai glyphs reliably, so Thai there would render as
boxes on some machines.

### Port already in use?

The Hub uses `5174` and nothing needs configuring for that. If something else on
the machine already owns that port, pass a different one to the installer and
everything downstream follows it:

```bash
# macOS / Linux
HUB_PORT=5180 ./automated-test-one-stop-service_installer_mac-and-linux.sh
```

```bat
REM Windows (quote the value — `set X=5180 &&` would keep the trailing space)
set "HUB_PORT=5180"
automated-test-one-stop-service_installer_windows.bat
```

### Removing it again

```bash
node scripts/setup/uninstall.mjs          # show exactly what would be removed
node scripts/setup/uninstall.mjs --run    # remove it (asks once to confirm)
```

It stops the Hub, removes the start-at-login registration, the desktop shortcut,
the setup ledger, and — on Windows — the `PATH` entries and environment variables
setup added. It deliberately **keeps** node/pnpm/uv/task (other projects may use
them) and your workspace folder (it holds your test projects); both are listed in
the output so nothing is a surprise.

### Removing the workspace folder as well

Add `--purge`, or use the uninstaller for your OS in `scripts/setup/` — same shape
as the installers:

- **Windows**: double-click `automated-test-one-stop-service_uninstaller_windows.bat`
- **macOS / Linux**: `bash automated-test-one-stop-service_uninstaller_mac-and-linux.sh`

```bash
node scripts/setup/uninstall.mjs --purge        # dry run: plan + anything blocking it
node scripts/setup/uninstall.mjs --purge --run  # delete the folder too (type its name to confirm)
```

This one is irreversible, so it is **gated** — and the gates are not bypassable,
not even with `--yes`. It refuses while any of these is still true, and prints
exactly which ones:

1. a test project exists under `tools/<tool>/projects/<type>/` (the shipped
   `*-template-example` scaffolds don't count)
2. a project folder other than `_workspace` exists under `brain/projects/`
3. any repo — the workspace, `brain/`, or a project under `tools/` — has
   uncommitted changes or commits that are on no remote
4. the Hub is still answering on `HUB_PORT` after the uninstall stopped it — it
   holds files inside the folder, so a delete would fail halfway; nothing is
   removed and it tells you to run `task hub-stop`

That order is deliberate: every project and the knowledge vault is its own git
repo, so delete your projects and push your work **first**, then purge. The
Windows launcher continues in a second window (a batch file cannot delete the
folder it is running from) — read that window for the result.

## CLI (no Hub required)

```bash
task                      # interactive runner
task setup                # install everything (first time)
task pw:run-local  PROJECT=<name> TYPE=web TAG='@smoke'
task robot:run-local PROJECT=<name> TYPE=web
task k6:run-local  PROJECT=<name> SECTION=<name> PERFORMANCE_TYPE=LOAD
task hub                  # start the Hub in dev mode — UI on :5173, API on :5174 (Ctrl+C to stop)
task hub-build            # build the Hub (production)
task hub-start            # serve the built Hub — UI and API both on :5174
task hub-stop             # stop the Hub running on HUB_PORT
task hub-restart          # stop, wait for the port, start again
task hub-status           # port, pid, and boot auto-start state
task --list               # all tasks
```

## Environment variables

Nothing here is required — a normal install and a normal run need none of it.
These are the escape hatches for locked-down machines, mirrors, and CI.

Install-time variables are read from the **process environment**, so pass them on
the command line. They are *not* read from `scripts/.env` — that file does not
exist yet while the installer runs.

Honoured by the 1-click installer:

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `HUB_PORT` | `5174` | Hub port. Everything downstream follows it — shortcut, launcher, readiness poll. |
| `SETUP_INSECURE_TLS=1` | off | Prefetch the Node tarball with `curl -k`. For TLS-inspecting corporate proxies. |
| `SETUP_DISABLE_SHELL_DECOUPLE=1` | off | Windows: skip putting Git's bundled GNU tools on `PATH`. Best-effort step, never required. |

```bash
# macOS / Linux — different port, behind a TLS-inspecting proxy
HUB_PORT=5180 SETUP_INSECURE_TLS=1 ./automated-test-one-stop-service_installer_mac-and-linux.sh
```

These three only apply when you run the setup script **directly**
(`bash scripts/setup/setup-linux.sh` / `scripts\setup\setup-windows.bat`). The
1-click installer sets all of them itself — it points the ledger at the folder you
chose, and opens the browser once after its own readiness poll — so setting them
on the installer has no effect:

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SETUP_STATE_DIR` | repo root | Where the `.setup-state.json` resume ledger is written. |
| `SETUP_NO_OPEN=1` | off | Do not open the browser when setup finishes. |
| `SETUP_NO_PAUSE=1` | off | Windows: skip the final "press any key". For unattended runs. |

Android is opt-in and never part of the install — these apply to `task setup-android`:

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SETUP_ANDROID_API` | `34` | API level of the system image and the `QA_Emulator` AVD. |
| `SETUP_ANDROID_CLT_URL` | resolved from the download page | Point at a mirrored `commandlinetools-*.zip` for offline or internal-mirror installs. |
| `SETUP_RECREATE_AVD=1` | off | Overwrite an existing `QA_Emulator` AVD instead of keeping it. |
| `ANDROID_HOME` | `~/Android/Sdk` — `~/Library/Android/sdk` on macOS, `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk` on Windows | Point at an SDK you already have (e.g. one Android Studio manages) instead of provisioning a second copy. |

Maintainer / CI only:

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SETUP_SMOKE=1` | off | Run the live-VM install smoke suite. Without it those tests skip, so the default suite never mutates a machine. |
| `SETUP_SMOKE_ANDROID=1` | off | Adds the Android checks — set only after `task setup-android` has run. |
| `SETUP_SMOKE_LAYERD=1` | off | Adds the shell-decoupling checks — set only after that step has run. |
| `EVAL_MIN_SCORE` | `70` | Pass threshold for the test-quality eval. |
| `EVAL_ROOTS` | `tools` | Comma-separated roots the eval scans. |
| `EVAL_JSON=1` | off | Emit the eval report as JSON instead of text. |
| `RELEASE_REMOTE` | `origin` | Remote `scripts/release.mjs` pushes to. |
| `RELEASE_BRANCH` | `main` | Branch it expects to release from. |
| `TAG_PREFIX` | `v` | Tag prefix it applies. |
| `CHUNK_DEBUG` | off | Print Vite chunk assignments during a Hub client build. |

Other scopes keep their own contract, so there is one place per concern:

- **Hub runtime** (`HUB_HOST`, `HUB_DB_PATH`, `HUB_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`, …) — [`hub/README.md`](hub/README.md#environment-variables)
- **Usage logging** (`SPREADSHEET_ID`, `SHEET_NAME`, `FORCE_TRACK`) — `scripts/.env.template`
- **Per-tool knobs** (`PLAYWRIGHT_DOWNLOAD_HOST`, `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH`, load profiles, …) — that tool's own `.env.template`
- **Per-project knobs** (base URLs, credentials) — that project's `.env.template`
